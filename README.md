# DRFNet-Iris
The Implementation of DRFNet Network for iris recognition. The Network is reference Toward More Accurate Iris Recognition Using Dilated Residual Features. And I only provide the realization of the network in the paper.

# Notice
The DET_curve.png was drawn after training with improved DRFNet. And the test data is CASIA-Iris-Lamp, which is not involved in training.
